            "\n",
            "Although there are around 20 Christmas markets in the Austrian capital from which to choose, Wiener Christkindlmarkt (or Rathausplatz) is one of its oldest and most traditional events.\n",
            "\n",
            "The event, also known as Viennese Dream Christmas Market, features a 110-square-meter children’s ice rink and is held in front of City Hall. The famous Tree of Hearts, a giant maple tree decked out with hundreds of glittering hearts, is a favorite with visitors and a great photo opportunity.\n",
            "\n",
            "Plenty of stalls offer up tasty treats such as Austrian sausages and gingerbread cookies, along with homemade Christmas punch.\n",

            "Separated into two sections at Barfüsserplatz and Münsterplatz, it’s made up of around 150 fabulously decorated stalls selling Christmas spices, decorations and candles.\n",
            "\n",
            "Family attractions include the Christmas fairytale forest at Münsterplatz with activities such as gingerbread and candle decorating, a star workshop and a festive train.\n",
            "\n",
            "Attendees can also take a walk up the stairwell of St. Martin’s tower for incredible views of the lights illuminating the old town or sip on some mulled wine at the 13-meter high Christmas pyramid on Barfüsserplatz.\n",
            "\n",
            "Basel Christmas Market opens on November 28 and is scheduled to run until December 23.\n",

            "A light and sound show, ice skating and fairground rides are among the activities and places to enjoy, while visitors can also browse through about 200 or so chalets serving glühwein (mulled wine), Belgian beers and waffles and stare in wonder at the enormous Christmas tree erected in Grand Place.\n",

            "While there’s no shortage of markets throughout the city, the main ones can be found in Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square. Thankfully these spots are only a few minutes’ walk apart, so revelers can easily visit both in a day.\n",
            "\n",
            "Old Town Square provides endless entertainment in the form of live shows, dance performances and creative workshops while Wenceslas Square is great for handmade gifts and local treats such as klobasa (Czech sausage) and mulled wine.\n",
