            "\n",
            "Die britische Königsfamilie zeigt sich gerne wohltätig - schweigt aber über finanzielle Verstrickungen. Recherchen zeigen, dass sie unter anderem viel Geld vom NHS, Schulen und der Armee erhält.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ende April besuchte Charles III. ein Zentrum der Krebshilfe Macmillan in London. Der König ist Schirmherr der Wohltätigkeitsorganisation und wirbt öffentlichkeitswirksam für deren Unterstützung.\n",
            "\n",
            "Was er dabei nicht erwähnt: Er selbst verdient an der Charity. Denn Macmillans Büro ist in einem Gebäude, das zum Privatbesitz des Monarchen gehört. Seit 2005 hat die Wohltätigkeitsorganisation umgerechnet fast 20 Millionen Euro Miete gezahlt.\n",

            "\n",
            "Dies ist nur ein Beispiel dafür, wie die britische Königsfamilie heimlich von Pachtzahlungen und Mietverträgen mit Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen und staatlichen Institutionen profitiert, die sie öffentlich unterstützen.\n",
            "\n",
            "Dieser Gegensatz sorgt gerade für Diskussionen im Vereinigten Königreich. Denn eine Recherche des Fernsehsenders Channel 4 und der Sunday Times zeigt Finanzströme auf, die vorher unter Verschluss waren.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Wer so in der Öffentlichkeit steht wie die Royals, braucht eine lupenreine weiße Weste\", sagt Dame Margaret Hodge, die lange im britischen Unterhaus saß und sich nun im Oberhaus mit Finanzen und Transparenzfragen beschäftigt.\n",
            "\n",
            "Dame Margaret Hodge Wenn eine Charity mehr Einnahmen hat, weil sie vom König unterstützt wird, aber dann diese Einnahmen über Mietzahlungen zurück an den König gibt - dann fühlt sich das einfach nicht richtig an.\n",

            "Im Mittelalter beschlagnahmt, noch heute lukrativ\n",
            "\n",
            "Die Königsfamilie bekommt jedes Jahr rund 100 Millionen Euro vom Staat - den sogenannten Sovereign Grant. Damit bezahlen sie den Unterhalt der Paläste, ihr Personal, Staatsbesuche und öffentliche Auftritte.\n",
            "\n",
            "Aber neben dem Sovereign Grant verdienen König Charles und Prinz William jedes Jahr zweistellige Millionenbeträge aus anderer Quelle. Die Herzogtümer Lancaster und Cornwall wurden im Mittelalter von Königen beschlagnahmt und gehören bis heute dem König und seinem Thronfolger.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Die Herzogtümer wurden damals illegal annektiert, um der Königsfamilie eine Art 'schwarze Kasse' zu verschaffen\", sagt der Monarchie-Kritiker Norman Baker.\n",

            "\n",
            "Die Dokumentation listet noch viele andere Beispiele auf, die für Diskussionen sorgen. Es geht zum Beispiel um ein Lagerhaus, in dem ein Londoner Krankenhaus Krankenwagen unterbringt. Umgerechnet 13,6 Millionen Euro über 15 Jahre zahlt der Gesundheitsdienst NHS dafür an Charles III..\n",
            "\n",
            "Prinz William profitiert von einem Geschäft mit dem Militär. Seit 2004 zahlte die Marine knapp 1,2 Millionen Euro dafür, um Anlegestellen in Cornwall zu bauen und zu nutzen. Staatliche Schulen zahlen rund 710.000 Euro für die Pacht der Grundstücke, auf denen sie stehen. Und Steuern zahlen müssen die Royals dafür nicht.\n",

            "Wie reagiert die britische Öffentlichkeit?\n",
            "\n",
            "Es sei ein PR-Desaster für den Palast, schreiben britische Zeitungen. Dabei geht es um mehr als das. Es geht um die Frage, ob die britische Monarchie Geld an den Institutionen verdienen sollte, die wie sie im Dienst der britischen Bevölkerung stehen.\n",
            "\n",
            "Buchautor Guy Shrubsole fordert die Rückgabe des Privatbesitzes an den Staat. Er sagt: \"Es ist an der Zeit, dass die Herzogtümer aufgelöst werden und die Gewinne an die Staatskasse gehen. Von dort aus fließt dann ein Teil an uns Steuerzahler zurück.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Vereinzelte Versuche von Politikern, mehr Transparenz über die Besitztümer zu fordern, sind in der Vergangenheit gescheitert. Ob die neuen Enthüllungen daran etwas ändern, wird auch davon abhängen, wie sehr die britische Bevölkerung reagiert. Bislang ist der Aufschrei ausgeblieben.\n"
